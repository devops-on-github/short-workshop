# GitHub Issues

We all need a way to plan our work, track issues, and talk about the things we build. Our answer to this universal question is [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/features/issues), and it‚Äôs built-in to every repository. GitHub‚Äôs issue tracking is special because of our focus on simplicity, references, and elegant formatting.

In GitHub, an **Issue** is not a bug, or even a piece of work. It's simply a starting point for some work or conversation that can be deeply linked to people, teams, other issues, commits, or nearly anything else. It's a living, trackable artifact that helps focus your team.

## Issue Creation

In this section of the workshop, we'll talk about what Issues are, then run through two exercises to create issues for our repository.

### üë©‚Äçüíª Exercise 1

[‚ñ∂Ô∏è Creating Issues](exercise-1.md)

In this exercise, we'll create an issue and explore the rich formatting features and deep linking available.

## Issue Templates and Forms

To maintain consistency and ensure we collect all the information we need for issues, GitHub supports Issue Templates and the newer Issue Forms. Both of these simply act as a way to prompt users for the correct information when creating an issue.

### Bonus Exercise

This exercise is provided for information, but we won't be doing it during the workshop.

[Exercise 2](exercise-2.md) walks you through creating templates and forms.
