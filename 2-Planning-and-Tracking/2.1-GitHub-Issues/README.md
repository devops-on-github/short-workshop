# GitHub Issues

We all need a way to plan our work, track issues, and talk about the things we build. Our answer to this universal question is [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/features/issues), and it’s built-in to every repository. GitHub’s issue tracking is special because of our focus on simplicity, references, and elegant formatting.

In GitHub, an **Issue** is not a bug, or even a piece of work. It's simply a starting point for some work or conversation that can be deeply linked to people, teams, other issues, commits, or nearly anything else. It's a living, trackable artifact that helps focus your team.

## Workshop Content

In this section of the workshop, we'll talk about what Issues are, then run through two exercises.

### 👩‍💻 (Guided) Exercise 1

[▶️ Create an Issue](exercise-1.md)

In this exercise, we'll create an issue and explore the rich formatting features and deep linking available.

_This is a guided exercise, so while you're welcome to jump ahead, you can also follow the proctor as they walk you through the process._

### 👩‍💻 Exercise 2

[▶️ Create more Issues](exercise-2.md)

Now that you know how to create issues, lets populate a few more issues. We will work on several of these issues throughout the workshop.
