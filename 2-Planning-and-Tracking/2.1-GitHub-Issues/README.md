# GitHub Issues

We all need a way to plan our work, track issues, and talk about the things we build. Our answer to this universal question is [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/features/issues), and it’s built-in to every repository. GitHub’s issue tracking is special because of our focus on simplicity, references, and elegant formatting.

In GitHub, an **Issue** is not a bug, or even a piece of work. It's simply a starting point for some work or conversation that can be deeply linked to people, teams, other issues, commits, or nearly anything else. It's a living, trackable artifact that helps focus your team.

## Workshop Content

### Issue Creation

In this section of the workshop, we'll talk about what Issues are, then run through two exercises to create issues for our repository.

#### 👩‍💻 (Guided) Exercise 1

[▶️ Create an Issue](exercise-1.md)

In this exercise, we'll create an issue and explore the rich formatting features and deep linking available.

_This is a guided exercise, so while you're welcome to jump ahead, you can also follow the proctor as they walk you through the process._

#### 👩‍💻 Exercise 2

[▶️ Create more Issues](exercise-2.md)

Now that you know how to create issues, lets populate a few more issues. We will work on several of these issues throughout the workshop.

### Issue Templates and Forms

To maintain consistency and ensure we collect all the information we need for issues, GitHub supports Issue Templates and the newer Issue Forms. Both of these simply act as a way to prompt users for the correct information when creating an issue.

#### 👩‍💻 Exercise 3

[▶️ Create Issue Templates and Forms](exercise-3.md)

Let's create an Issue Template for a logging a bug, and then create an Issue Form for adding a feature request.
