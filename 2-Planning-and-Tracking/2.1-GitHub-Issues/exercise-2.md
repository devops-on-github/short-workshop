# Exercise 2 - Create more Issues

Now you know how to create Issues, let's populate a small backlog of work to do during this workshop.

_You're welcome to populate these issues any way you'd like, including using task lists and "child" issues, but you should make sure they're recognisable. In other words, don't stray too much from the titles below!_

## Create 3 more issues for the following, including any useful details:
1. Update meta description for social media cards (currently the meta description reads "Some of the best haikus you'll ever read about our rescue dog June")
2. Add a new Haiku about this workshop (we can use the https://www.poem-generator.org.uk/ site to do the work for us!)
3. Update the README to describe this project
