# Exercise 3 - Create a Personal Backlog

In this exercise, you'll create a new view for your personal work. While we'll make suggestions for how it should look, this is your view so customize it in a way that works for you!

**We won't give you step-by-step instructions for this exercise. Instead, create a new view that meets the following requirements:**

1. Project table view (not a board)
2. Grouped by priority
3. Only include open issues not marked as done

Beyond those requirements, you're free to customize this and any other board as you see fit!

### One last thing

Before we finish this section, navigate back to the Projects tab of your repository. Once again, add a project, but this time search for the project you just created (It's likely to be in the recent list).

Adding a project to the repository simply gives you an easy link to the project. It still belongs to the organisation!
