# Planning and Tracking
Whether you're a sales-driven "waterfall" org or an agile team practicing Scrum or Kanban, it's important to effectively plan and track the work your team and organisation perform. You also need effective ways to communicate, both within your team and organisation, but also with your communities.

## üìå GitHub Issues
We all need a way to plan our work, track issues, and talk about the things we build. Our answer to this universal question is [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/features/issues), and it‚Äôs built-in to every repository. GitHub‚Äôs issue tracking is special because of our focus on simplicity, references, and elegant formatting.

## üó£Ô∏è GitHub Discussions
[GitHub Discussions](https://resources.github.com/devops/process/planning/discussions/) brings community forums right to your public or private repositories on GitHub making it easy to communicate with your community, ask and answer questions, share updates, and more.

## üóìÔ∏è Project Tables and Boards
As teams and projects grow, how we work evolves. Tools that hard-code a specific methodology are too specific and rigid to flex to whatever the moment demands. Often, we find ourselves creating a spreadsheet or pulling out a notepad, just to have the space to think. But then our planning is disconnected from where the work happens and quickly goes stale.

[The new Projects](https://github.com/features/issues) connect your planning directly to the work your teams are doing, and flexibly adapt to whatever your team needs at any point. Built like a spreadsheet, project tables give you a live canvas to filter, sort, and group issues and pull requests. You can use it, or the accompanying project board, along with custom fields, to track a sprint, plan a feature, or manage a large-scale release.
