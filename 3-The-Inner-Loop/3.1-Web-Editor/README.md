# The Web-Based Editor

The web-based editor introduces a lightweight editing experience that runs entirely in your browser. With the web-based editor, you can navigate files and source code repositories from GitHub, and make and commit code changes. You can open any repository, fork, or pull request in the editor.

The web-based editor is available to everyone for free on GitHub.com.

The web-based editor provides many of the benefits of Visual Studio Code, such as search, syntax highlighting, and a source control view. You can also use Settings Sync to share your own VS Code settings with the editor. For more information, see "Settings Sync" in the VS Code documentation.

The web-based editor runs‚ÄØentirely in your browser‚Äôs sandbox. The editor doesn‚Äôt clone the repository, but instead uses the GitHub Repositories extension to carry out most of the functionality that you will use. Your work is saved in the browser‚Äôs local storage until you commit it. You should commit your changes regularly to ensure that they're always accessible.

## Using the Web Editor

To access the web-based editor, you can press the `.` key on your keyboard while viewing a repository, a file, or a pull request on github.com. Alternatively, you can simply change the URL to replace github.com with github.dev - leaving the rest of the URL the same.

In this section, we're going to run through some exercises to show how you can accomplish real tasks using the web-based editor.

### üë©‚Äçüíª Exercise 1

[‚ñ∂Ô∏è Make a simple change](exercise-1.md)

In this exercise, we'll make a simple change to a file in our repository. We'll also show how you can link your work to an issue using built-in extensions.

### üë©‚Äçüíª Exercise 2

[‚ñ∂Ô∏è Approve a pull request](exercise-2.md)

In this exercise, we're going to open a pull request and approve it. We'll see how the web-based editor is context-aware and gives a great PR review experience.

### üë©‚Äçüíª Exercise 3

[‚ñ∂Ô∏è Submit a pull request](exercise-3.md)

In this exercise, we'll open the web-editor for a repository we _don't_ own and see what the experience is like for contributing to other projects.
