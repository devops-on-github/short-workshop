# Codespaces

[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) takes the cloud editor idea further, giving you Visual Studio Code backed by high performance VMs that start in seconds. Unlike the web-based editor, Codespaces are backed by VMs so you can compile and debug as if you were on a local machine. 

The advantages of using Codespaces over local development are many. You can standardize on a set of dependencies for a project, onboard a new developer in seconds rather than days, and spin up and tear down context-aware Codespaces at a moment's notice. You can choose (and restrict your team to) different machine sizes, prebuild your Codespaces to reduce onboarding, and customize your development containers however you'd like.

Codespaces is currently a paid feature, however there are plans to release a free offering at some point soon. What that offering looks like is yet to be determined.

## For this workshop...

We've enabled Codespaces for our organization, and **you will not be billed for using them in this organization**. However, if you create Codespaces for your person repositories or other organisations, billing will apply as standard.

You're welcome to play and experiment with Codespaces during the workshop, but we trust you not to go crazy with them. No cryptomining please ;)

## Using Codespaces

In this section, we'll primarily be running through _guided_ exercises. While Codespaces are easy to configure and use, it's helpful if everyone ends up with similar machines. Don't worry, you'll be on your own by exercise 3!

### üë©‚Äçüíª Guided Exercise 1

[‚ñ∂Ô∏è Create a Codespace and debug](exercise-1.md)

In this guided exercise, we'll create a Codespace and explore what it looks like and how it differs from a web-based editor. We'll run and debug our application and do some sharing.

### üë©‚Äçüíª Guided Exercise 2

[‚ñ∂Ô∏è Customize the dev container](exercise-2.md)

In this guided exercise, we'll run through some ways we can customize our Codespace. We'll get our Codespace working for us, then we'll save the customization.

### üë©‚Äçüíª Exercise 3

[‚ñ∂Ô∏è Use a Codespace to do some work](exercise-3.md)

In this exercise, we'll actually do some work using a Codespace! We're going to start from scratch with our new customizations, then pick up an issue and implement it with the help of Copilot!
