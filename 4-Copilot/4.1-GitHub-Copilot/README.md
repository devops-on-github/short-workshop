# Pair Program with GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot allows you to speed up your developer productivity with an AI pair programmer.

You can code faster with less work by leveraging GitHub Copilot‚Äôs ability to convert comments to code, recognize patterns, and make alternative suggestions.

Let's explore how you can pair program with AI in our app. The best part is you don‚Äôt have to be proficient in GitHub Copilot or even Javascript!

## Prompting GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot is an extension that can be installed in Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Neovim, and JetBrains IDEs.

Fun fact: GitHub Copilot can provide suggestions for numerous languages and a wide variety of frameworks, but works especially well for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Go, C# and C++.

To get the best out of GitHub Copilot, we need to provide some good context. Let‚Äôs try to prompt GitHub Copilot to suggest some code for us.

### üë©‚Äçüíª Exercise 1

[‚ñ∂Ô∏è Prompting Copilot](exercise-1.md)

In this exercise, we'll get started with Copilot and use it to help implement a couple of the issues we created earlier.

### üë©‚Äçüíª Exercise 2

[‚ñ∂Ô∏è Writing a whole function with Copilot](exercise-2.md)

In this exercise, we're going to stretch GitHub Copilot's capabilities a little more and see if it can help us write a whole new function.
