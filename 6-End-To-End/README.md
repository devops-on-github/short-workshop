# Bringing it all together!

We've covered a lot in the end-to-end DevOps (or DevSecOps) lifecycle.

![DevOps Lifecycle](../images/lifecycle.png)

We looked at:
- Discussions, Issues, and Projects for our "Idea" and "Learn" phases
- Codespaces for our "Build" phase
- GitHub Actions for our "Ship" phase (and much more!)
- GitHub Advanced Security for security throughout our lifecycle.

One area that GitHub arguably doesn't have an offering for is operating and monitoring your deployed software. Of course, depending on how you define "operating", there are features you can rely on (e.g. Actions for building infrastructure and running Ops tasks).

That said, GitHub has supplied everything we need to get from an idea all the way to working software in production.

There's one final exercise we'll run through - tying everything together!

## üë©‚Äçüíª Exercise 1

[‚ñ∂Ô∏è Tying it all together](exercise-1.md)

In this exercise we'll start with an idea, and we'll see it all the way through to production. You should have already created most of the moving parts, so this is more about seeing them work together effectively.
