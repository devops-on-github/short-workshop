# Exercise 1 - Tying it all together

In this exercise we'll start with an idea, and we'll see it all the way through to production. You should have already created most of the moving parts, so this is more about seeing them work together effectively.

_Note: If you've skipped or been unable to finish any of the exercises in this workshop, you may find some of the steps below won't be accurate. Continue as best you can, but ask for help if you need._

_Note 2: This exercise will be self-driven. If you get stuck, try referring back to the relevant sections of this workshop, but you can always rely on the proctors if you're truly unable to work it out!_

1. Navigate to Discussions in your repository
2. Find the new Discussion created by one of the workshop team :)
3. Create an issue from this Discussion and add appropriate labels. Assign yourself to this Issue.
4. Visit your project page to verify the issue has been added (you may need to wait for your workflow to run), and add any additional custom values as appropriate.
5. Use the web-based editor or Codespaces to perform the work required. Make sure you're working on a branch!
6. When you're done, commit (and push) your changes, then create a pull request - make sure you reference the issue with the `#` notation!
7. Ensure that all the status checks complete successfully, then merge the PR.
8. Navigate to the `Actions` tab to watch the CI/CD process, and approve the deployment to production when needed.
9. Finally, navigate back to your project board to check that issue has been moved to a Done status.
