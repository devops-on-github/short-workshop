# End to End DevOps with GitHub

Welcome to the **End to End DevOps with GitHub** workshop!

This repository is your source for all the workshop materials. You'll find topics in folders and markdown files in each folder with each piece of learning material and exercise.

This repository also has [Discussions](https://github.com/devops-on-github/workshop/discussions) enabled for Q&A and conversation as we go.

# Getting Started:
In this workshop, you'll primarily use your own private repository to work on.

To set up your repository, go to https://github.com/github/haikus-for-codespaces and click ![Use this Template](images/use-template.png)

Make sure you add the template as a repository **in this organization** by choosing `devops-on-github` as the owner. 

![devops-on-github should be the owner](images/in-org.png)

Give it any name, but remember this will be the repository you use for the whole workshop. Make sure you'll recognise it as your own. There's no need to include every branch.
